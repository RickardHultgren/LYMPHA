title: NPH
---

About 2% of elderly people suffers from normal pressure hydrocephalus. It is a condition that can be successfully treated with not so complicated surgery. Unfortunately, it is easily mistaken for Alzheimer. The following symptoms can occur in NPH:

- Gait disturbance
- Dementia
- Urinary incontinence

All these symptoms can be measured with a smartphone. The gait speed can be measured. The frequency of urination can be done. Dementia can be measured with games. The challenge with such an app would be how to handle the result. Should it be a part of the medical journal? Who should know about the results? In my opinion, a credit sized card with storing capabilities would be perfect for the patient to have his/her journal on. The phone could perhaps have a card reader or communicate with the card through NFC. In some countries like Sweden do the medical journals not belong to the patient, but to the caregiver. This makes the approach even more complicated since it starts to become a legal and political issue.
