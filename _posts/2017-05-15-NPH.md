title: Normal pressure hydrocephalus
---

About 2% of elderly people suffers from normal pressure hydrocephalus. It is a condition that can be succefully treted with not so complicated surgery. Unfortunately it is easely misstaken for Alzheimer. The following symptoms can occur in NPH:
- Gait disturbance 
- Dementia
- Urinary incontinence

All these symptoms can be measured with a smartphone. The gait speed can be measured. Frequency of urination can be done. The dementia can be measured with games. The challange with such an app would be how to handle the result. Should it be a part of the medical journal? Who should know about the results? In my opinion a credit sized card with storing capabilites would be perfect for the patient to have his/her journal on. The phone could perhaps have a cardreader or communicate with the card through <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Near_field_communication">NFC</a>. In some counties like Sweden do the medical journals not belong to the patient, but to the care giver. This make the approach even more complicated since it starts to become a legal and political issue.
