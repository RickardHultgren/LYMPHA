title: Seizure treatment
---

**Crowd sourcing first aid as e.g. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=niwFcvo5Nfk">GoodSam</a> is a great idea. But the GoodSam-project is focused on cardiac arrest. Could the concept work for other diseases with attacks that need urgent care, like e.g. epilepsy with tonic-clonic seizure?**

The most minimal commitment that you are asked to do with the GoodSam app is to bring a defibrillator to a certain position and mount it according to instructions. Most people can do that. In the case of an epileptic tonic-clonic seizure, a minimal commitment would be to avoid the patient from hurting him/herself and to put him/her in a recovery position if possible. To put someone in a recovery position may take some practice but with good instructions, it should not be that difficult in most of the cases. If the seizure takes more than five minutes one should call for an ambulance, and if possible give medications. I believe such instructions could be given in a smartphone app. A smartphone app could also be used for practicing first aid and triage. Such an app could perhaps look a little bit like the three days <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rB6c_8itKDw">course</a> for First Responders in the UK. With the help of gamification such an app could be both educative and fun to use. Depending on scores and skills practiced the app could rank delegate users in a real situation.
