title: Anxiety and depression
---
Anxiety and depression are among the most common diseases in the industrialized countries. There is no quick fix for such disorders. Medications just make the patient's load easier to bear. The patient has to find out how he/she can bear it. Psychotherapy, like e.g. <span class="sc">cbt</span> can often give guidance on how to do this. Nowadays there are several <span class="sc">cbt</span> programs/apps in digital format. The digital <span class="sc">cbt</span> has been shown to be effective, but as I know there are no open source programs. <span class="sc">Lympha</span> must have so called client-apps in order to communicate with patients. As a first <span class="sc">lympha</span>-client-project I think a depression/anxiety-app would be a good idea. It would deliver <span class="sc">rebt</span>-psychotherapy and assess the result with daily emotional journal and a monthly <a class="sc" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montgomery%E2%80%93%C3%85sberg_Depression_Rating_Scale">madrs</a>-questionair. In more severe levels of depression a referral could be produced with statistics and issues that the patient struggles with.
