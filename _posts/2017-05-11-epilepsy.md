title: The fear about tomorrow in epilepsy
---

**No matter if it is digital or on paper -- a diary for triggers and symptoms of epilepsy can be very useful. It is a good tool for adjusting medication and other treatments. When a stable and satisfying result is achieved the patient does not need to keep any diary. But for some patients, this is never achieved. Perhaps no medication works satisfyingly, or the side effects are too strong. The treatment for other illnesses that the patient has may also make it hard to treat epilepsy. Each day is a struggle of weighing the tasks of the day, the medication's side effect and the actual disease's symptoms. "The medication makes me so sick, but if I don't take it I'll probably have a seizure."**

In what ways can a program help you in managing epilepsy and wellbeing? Several apps function as an alarm clock, diaries, reminders etc. You put data into the app about when you would like to do certain things (e.g. waking up). After doing what you planned to do you write about your achievements in the diary. The problem with this approach is that it is hard or very hard to follow your plans, especially when you are feeling ill. People have a tendency of thinking of them self in other ways in the future than right now. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uvvQrqIRLGU">Dan Ariely explains it very well</a>. The hard work of managing and replanning the things that have not yet been done is entirely left to the patient. If instead a computer program or an app could receive data about the actual condition right now, then different alternatives can be presented. E.g. the smartphone says:

<link href="https://afeld.github.io/emoji-css/emoji.css" rel="stylesheet">
<div style="border-left:0.5em solid #888888">You say that you feel bad. You have only slept for five hours and have now taken medication XYZ. The alternatives you have are now
   - to take medication ABC and rest. Forecast outcome: <i class="em em-some-emoji">em-smile</i>
   - to proceed without extra medication and be prepared for feeling bad today. Forecast outcome: <i class="em em-some-emojiworried"></i>
</div>

This way the patient hopefully could take control of his/her life.
