title: The fear about tomorrow in epilepsy
---

**No matter if it is digital or on paper -- a diary about triggers and symptoms of epilepsy can be very useful. It can be very helpful for adjustments in medication and other treatments. The goal is to achieve  a stable and satisfying result. But for some patients this is never achieved. Perhaps the side effects are too strong. Perhaps the side effects need to be medicated, with medications that generate new side effects. Each day might be a struggle of weighing the tasks of the day; the medication's side effect and the risk of getting seizure.**

In what ways can a program help you in managing epilepsy and wellbeing? Several apps function as an alarm clock; diaries; reminders etc. You tell your smartphone about your plans, e.g. waking up at 6 AM. At the end of the day you write about your achievements in the diary. That approach for time management is fine, but the problem is that the more you have to manage, the harder it is to follow your plans; especially when you are feeling ill. People have a tendency of thinking of them self in other ways in the future than right now. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uvvQrqIRLGU">Dan Ariely explains it very well</a>. The hard work of managing and replanning the things that have not yet been done is entirely left to the patient. If instead a computer program or an app could receive data about the actual condition right now; then different alternatives can be presented. E.g. the smartphone says:

<p style="border-left:0.5em solid #888888; padding-left:0.5em;">You say that you feel bad. You have only slept for five hours and have now taken medication XYZ. The alternatives you have are now
   <br><br>
   to take medication ABC and rest. Forecast outcome: :-)
   <br><br>
   to proceed without extra medication and be prepared for feeling bad today. Forecast outcome: :-(
