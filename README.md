# LYMPHA
LYMPHA is a logical language for formulating and handling medical algorithms. The aim of the project is to provide syntax guide lines as well as structural rules for reading LYMPHA scripts. Interpreters and compilers are built upon those rules. The LYMPHA project is open-source, licensed under a bsd 2.

The JavaScript version requires [viz.js](https://github.com/mdaines/viz.js/releases).
