Each of us sometimes needs assistence and help with our health. The aim of  <span class="sc">lympha</span> is to build a free and transparant digital platform for managing health. It would assist you in managing your own health, as well as helping you helping others. The project is just in its very early stages. <a href="http://rickardhultgren.github.io/lympha/about#use">Read about how I imagine using lympha</a> and <a href="http://rickardhultgren.github.io/lympha/about#progress">follow the progression of the work</a>. The <a href="http://rickardhultgren.github.io/lympha/demo">demo</a> demonstrates how clinical flowcharts can be produced. The finished program is thought to consolidate different medical protocols and compare them with data from the patient. It would enable computers to propose what further diagnostics and treatments can be prescribed. In other words, <span class="sc">lympha</span> will be a <a class="sc" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_decision_support_system">cdss</a> and a programming language for medical protocols.  <span class="sc">Lympha</span> is open source (<a href="http://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-2-Clause"><span class="sc">bsd 2</span></a>).
