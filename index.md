A person's health is something that belongs to her. In order to have a good health the person sometimes need help. The aim of  <span class="sc">lympha</span> is to give the patient (health-owner) and health care professionals a transparent digital platform for managing health. It is a programming language for formulating medical protocols. With <span class="sc">lympha</span> the computer consolidates different protocols and compare them with data from the patient. It computes what further diagnostics and treatment could be prescribed for the patient.</span>

<span class="sc">Lympha</span> is just in its very early stages. I plan the release date of version 1.0 later this year. The project is open-source, licensed under the <a href="http://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-2-Clause"><span class="sc">bsd 2</span> license</a>. The progression of work can be followed on the <a href="about.md">"about site"</a>. On that site you can also read about how I imagine different ways of using c.

The <a href="http://rickardhultgren.github.io/lympha/demo">demo</a> demonstrates how flowcharts can be produced. It is  based on a simplyfied version of <span class="sc">lympha</span>. Hope the demo version can help you improving someoneâ€™s health.
