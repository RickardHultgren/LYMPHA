A person's health should be this person's health. Sometimes the person needs help with managing the health, but the health should still be owned by that person. Sometimes a leader is required to make the person taking control over her health. The aim of  <span class="sc">lympha</span> is to give the patient (health-owner) and health care professionals a transparent digital platform  for building good health. It is a programming language for formulating medical protocols. With <span class="sc">lympha</span> the computer consolidates different protocols and compare them with data from the patient. It computes what further diagnostics and treatment should be prescribed for the patient in question.


What is missing in this JavasScript version are the decision-support-functions that I have created. I have described the function as computer algorithms in the document<a href="https://github.com/RickardHultgren/lympha/blob/master/LYMPHA_algorithm.0.1.pdf"><span>lympha</span> algorithms</a>. I plan to translate the algorithms to JavaScript and to make a Python modul/library based on the algoithms. The release of tha planned work is will be the 1.0 version of <span class="sc">lympha</span>. If I can get financial support I plan the release date of version 1.0 on the 1st of October, 2017. <span class="sc">Lympha</span> is just in its very early stages. The project is open-source, licensed under the <a href="http://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-2-Clause"><span class="sc">bsd 2</span> license</a>. The progression of work can be followed on the <a href="about.md">"about tab"</a>. The sooner I will finish the 1.0 version the sooner I can begin the work on implementing <span class="sc">lympha</span> in health care with the focus on mental health care.
