To assist you managing your own health, and help you helping othersâ€”that is the goal of the <span class="sc">lympha</span> project. It will be a digital platform for managing health. Free for everyone to use. The finished computer program will consolidate medical protocols and compare the protocols with data from the patient. Computers could then propose diagnostics and treatments. This would give caregivers more time to care and connect with the patient.
<br><br>
Wishing you good health management
