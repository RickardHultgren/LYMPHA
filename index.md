A person's health is something that belongs to her. But in order to have a good health the person sometimes need help from others. The aim of  <span class="sc">lympha</span> is to give the patient and the health care professionals a transparent digital platform for managing health. It is an open source (<a href="http://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-2-Clause"><span class="sc">bsd 2</span></a>) <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_decision_support_system">CDSS</a> and programming language for medical protocols. With <span class="sc">lympha</span> the computer consolidates different protocols and compare them with data from the patient. In this way it computes what further diagnostics and treatment could be prescribed for the patient.

The project is just in its very early stages. <a href="about.md/#use">"Read about how I imagine using lympha"</a> and <a href="about.md/#progress">follow the progession of the work</a>. The <a href="http://rickardhultgren.github.io/lympha/demo">demo</a>  demonstrates how flowcharts can be produced. It is  based on a simplyfied version of <span class="sc">lympha</span>. Hope the demo can help you improving someoneâ€™s health.
