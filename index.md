A person's health is something that belongs to her. But in order to have a good health, the person sometimes needs help from others. The aim of  <span class="sc">lympha</span> is to give the patient and the health care professionals a digital platform for managing health. The project is just in its very early stages. <a href="http://rickardhultgren.github.io/lympha/about#use">Read about how I imagine using lympha</a> and <a href="http://rickardhultgren.github.io/lympha/about#progress">follow the progression of the work</a>. The <a href="http://rickardhultgren.github.io/lympha/demo">demo</a> demonstrates how flowcharts can be produced. The finished version is thought to consolidate different protocols and compare them with data from the patient. It would enable compters to propose what further diagnostics and treatments can be prescribed. In other words, <span class="sc">lympha</span> will be a <a class="sc" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_decision_support_system">cdss</a> and a programming language for medical protocols.  <span class="sc">Lympha</span> is open source (<a href="http://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-2-Clause"><span class="sc">bsd 2</span></a>).
