\section{Introduction}
\ \\
The possibilities of treating diseases increase in a rapid speed. Consequently both diagnostics and treatment become more complex. The purpose of {\sc lympha} is to give clarity to those complex reasonings. {\sc Lympha} is a logical language for formulating medical algorithms. The language can be applied as {\it clinical decision support system}.

The clinical work flow is dealing with series of events effecting the patients condition and evaluations of the condition. In {\sc lympha} this is put as {\it statements} devided by \code{->} building up a {\it serie}. A serie ends with semicolon as follows:\\\\
\comment{statement} \code{->} \comment{statement} \code{->} \comment{statement} \code{;}
\regex{[\textasciicircum ;]*(?=;)}
\ \vspace{-2em}\\
\python{[x.strip() for x in serie.split(''->'')]}
\ \\
A statement has either value of true (\code{1}) if it is executed, or false (\code{0}). A statemtent is further devided into these parts:\\\\
\comment{variable name} \code{(} \comment{specification} \code{) =} \comment{content}
\regex{($\backslash$w*$[$a-zA-Z]$\backslash$w*$\backslash$.)$\backslash$(\textasciicircum[\textasciicircum$\backslash$)]*?(?=$\backslash$))?$\backslash$s*?=$\backslash$s*?(\textasciicircum[\textasciicircum ;]*?(?=;))}
\ \\
Events effecting the condition includes ethymology, diagnostics and treatment. E.g. a bone frature that is examined and then treated. Some medical procedures are both diagnostical and treatment. Nevertheless these are events, that are semanticly separated from the evaluation of data from an event. The evaluation does oftne consist of sub-evaluation that will become factors in the main-evaluation: Therefore there are these two {\it datatypes} in {\sc lympha}: {\it events} and {\it factors}.
\section{Variable name}
Variable names are one word with at least one letter. The last character of the name indicates what datatype the variable has.
\begin{itemize}
\item {\it Events}; Always end with a full stop (\code{.}).
\item {\it Factors}; Always end with a questionmark (\code{?}).
\end{itemize}
Even though both datatypes have a structure of an element as explained above, the parts looks a little bit different.
\section{Specifications}
A specification is a sub-variable. It is built as follow:\\\\
\comment{datatype} \code{[} \comment{sub-variable name} \code{] =} \comment{content}
\regex{($\backslash$w*$[$a-zA-Z]$\backslash$w*$\backslash$)$\backslash$[\textasciicircum[\textasciicircum$\backslash$]]*?(?=$\backslash$])?$\backslash$s*?=$\backslash$s*?($\backslash$w*$[$a-zA-Z]$\backslash$w*$\backslash$)}
\ 
\\
Here follows how structurize the parts:
\subsection{Dataype}
This datatype describes what data the sub-variable is describing. These datatypes are used:\\\\
\begin{tabular}{r|l}
{\it Dataype} & {\it Meaning}\\
\hline L & length \\
\hline L2 & surface area \\
\hline L3 & volume \\
\hline M & mass \\
\hline N & mole \\
\hline -T & time elapsed\\
\hline \%s & string \\
\hline R & other real numbers\\
\end{tabular}
\subsection{Sub-variable name}
These is the name or unit of the data.
\subsection{Sub-variable  content}
This is the value. All strings has quoationmarks at the beginning and at the end.
\section{Content}
These is the part of a statement that separates factors from events. The goal of a factor content is to evaluate data. The goal of event content is to descripe sub-events.
\newpage
\subsection{Event content}
This is one serie of events and factors separted with commas \code{,}:\\\\
\code{\{} \comment{event} \code{,} \comment{factor} \code{,} \comment{event} \code{\}}
\python{[x.strip() for x in content.split(',')]}
\subsection{Factor content}
This is an evaluation of other sub-factors. Sub events are not allowed to be included in factor content.\\\\
\code{} \comment{tipping point} \hspace{2em} \comment{relational operator} \code{|\{} \comment{sub-factor} \code{,} \comment{sub-factor} \code{\}|}
\regex{($\backslash$d)$\backslash$s*?(==|>|<|>=|<=)$\backslash$s*?\{($\backslash$w*$[$a-zA-Z]$\backslash$w*$\backslash$)\}}
Valid rational operators

\begin{tabular}{l|l}
{\it relational operator} & {\it read as}\\
\hline{\textcolor{violet}{\tt ==}} & if and only if ($\equiv$)\\
{\textcolor{violet}{\tt >}} & greater than \\
{\textcolor{violet}{\tt >=}} & greater than or equal ($\geq$)\\
{\textcolor{violet}{\tt <}} & lesser than\\
{\textcolor{violet}{\tt <=}} & less than or equal ($\leq$)\\
{\textcolor{violet}{\tt !=}} & not equal to ($\neq$)\\
\end{tabular}\\\\\\
